******RELEVANT PROJECTS**	****

**Personal Expense Tracker**

The Personal Expense Tracker is a command-line Python application that allows users to track and manage their daily expenses. This project is designed to help users understand how to build a real-world application using basic to intermediate Python concepts, with a focus on data handling, user input, file management, and simple reporting.

Key Features:
Add Expense Entries
Users can input daily expenses by entering the date, category (e.g., food, travel, utilities), amount, and description.
View Expense History
Users can view all previous expense records in a readable format sorted by date.
Search by Category or Date
Allows filtering expenses by category or date to help users analyze spending patterns.
Monthly Summary Report
Calculates total expenses for the current month and breaks them down by category.
Persistent Data Storage
Uses a CSV file or JSON file to save and load expense records, so the data is not lost between program runs.
**Technical Details:**
**Language: Python 3.x**
**Libraries Used:**
**datetime (for date management)**
**csv or json (for file handling)**
**os (optional, for file path management)**
**Structure: Modular code with functions for each major feature (e.g., add_expense(), view_history(), generate_report()).**

**Learning Objectives:**
Practice basic programming constructs (loops, conditionals, functions)
Gain experience with file I/O (reading/writing CSV or JSON)
Understand how to structure a simple CLI application
Gain experience with debugging and user input validation

**Optional Enhancements (Advanced):**
Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter
Integrate SQLite or another database for better data management
Export reports to a PDF or Excel file using reportlab or openpyxl

***********Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform for HR & Workforce Management**************
This is USA based project.Led the architecture and development of a multi-tenant SaaS platform using ASP.NET Core 6, designed to help small and mid-sized companies manage their employees, schedules, leave policies, and payroll processing.

This enterprise-level solution was built with modular microservices, role-based access control, and integrated Stripe billing for subscription management. The platform supports white-label customization, audit logging, and real-time notifications via SignalR.

The system was deployed using Azure App Services, Key Vault, and Azure SQL, with scalable infrastructure and zero-downtime updates through blue-green deployments.

***Technology Stack****
Backend: ASP.NET Core 6 Web API, Clean Architecture
Frontend (Optional): Blazor Server + Tailwind CSS
Database: Azure SQL + Entity Framework Core + Redis Cache
Identity & Security: IdentityServer4, JWT, OAuth 2.0, Azure B2C
Billing: Stripe Integration with webhook-based event processing
Multi-Tenancy: Custom tenant resolution via subdomain and token claims
Real-Time: SignalR for live HR notifications (e.g., leave approvals, clock-ins)
Cloud: Azure App Services, Azure Storage, Azure Key Vault, Application Insights
DevOps: GitHub Actions + Bicep templates for infrastructure as code

***Key Responsibilities & Highlights***

 Architected a multi-tenant design with tenant isolation at both data and logic levels.
 Implemented modular service layers (HR, Payroll, Leave, Attendance) using Clean Architecture and CQRS with MediatR.
 Integrated Stripe for recurring billing and in-app plan upgrades, handling webhook events and retries.
 Designed and enforced role-based access using ASP.NET Core Identity and Claims-based authorization.
 Developed real-time alerting using SignalR, allowing admins to monitor live attendance and receive leave notifications.
 Built automated PDF reports for payroll summaries and employee evaluations using the iTextSharp library.
 Wrote unit and integration tests (xUnit + FluentAssertions) for core services and controller layers.
 Managed deployment via GitHub Actions with blue-green rollouts and monitored production with Application Insights.

**Results & Business Impact**

 Onboarded over 50 clients across 10 countries within the first 3 months of launch.
 Achieved 95% user satisfaction based on UX, speed, and reporting features.
 Handled over 100,000 payroll records/month with optimized batch processing.
 Enabled effortless scaling across tenants with isolated databases and shared app service plans.
