*********Bonita Conservative Club******

Recently, I worked with **TechUnited** on a USA-based project for the **Bonita Conservative Club**, focused on building and maintaining a custom CRM system designed to support civil and logical conversations around tested protocols and fair platform practices. The system's objective was to foster meaningful engagement and transparency — operating under the belief that on a fair platform, truth ultimately prevails, while unfair systems give rise to misinformation.

The CRM platform was built using **Angular 11** on the frontend and **ASP.NET Core Web API** on the backend, with **MS SQL Server** powering the database. It was deployed and managed using **Azure cloud infrastructure**, with **GitHub** used for source control, issue tracking, and CI/CD workflows.

### Key Areas of My Contribution:

* **Frontend (Angular 11):**

  * Fixed UI/UX bugs involving reactive forms, validation messages, and performance delays in complex modules like pipelines and filters.
  * Improved user interface responsiveness and implemented minor feature enhancements, such as real-time notifications and advanced filtering options.

* **Backend (ASP.NET Core Web API):**

  * Debugged business logic related to task assignments, user role management, and contact syncing.
  * Optimized API endpoints and database queries, improving system performance and reducing response times across key modules.

* **Database (MS SQL Server):**

  * Resolved issues around duplicated or inconsistent data records.
  * Designed and updated stored procedures and views to support new reporting features.

* **DevOps & Cloud Tools:**

  * Used **GitHub** for version control and collaborative code reviews.
  * Integrated automated deployment pipelines using **GitHub Actions** and deployed services via **Microsoft Azure**, ensuring smooth rollouts with minimal downtime.

This project required not only strong technical skills but also an understanding of the client’s mission: providing a platform grounded in fairness, logic, and constructive dialogue. It was rewarding to contribute to a system built to enable honest conversations in a time where platform integrity truly matters.
